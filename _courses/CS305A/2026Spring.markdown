##### **Instructors**

[Zhuozhao Li](https://zhuozhaoli.github.io/), 李卓钊
- Office: RM 516, South Tower, CoE Building (工学院南楼516)
- Office hour: Friday 16:00-18:00, or email to schedule an appointment.


##### **Course Descriptions**

Using the Internet as a vehicle, this course introduces the underlying concepts and principles of modern computer networks, with emphasis on protocols, architectures, and implementation issues. We will teach how to implement network applications (e.g., e-mail, FTP) using the existing network protocols and architectures and how/why these protocols and architectures work by using the layered organization of the Internet in a top-down fashion: application, transport, network, data link, and physical layers. The course will also cover advanced topics such as software-defined networking and wireless and mobile networks.

##### **Course Materials**

- Textbook: Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach, J. Kurose & K. Ross, Pearson, 8th Edition, 2020
